# Greedy Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of classic **Greedy Algorithm**
problems implemented in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebooks**.

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the
hope of finding a global optimum solution.

## 📌 Example: Fractional Knapsack

**Approach:**
1. Compute value/weight ratio for each item
2. Sort items in descending order of ratio
3. Take full items while capacity allows
4. Take fraction of next item if required

**Time Complexity:**  
`O(n log n)` (due to sorting)
